	<b>Buildings as Canvas</b>
	<p>Using light projected on the walls, the originally mundane buildings became medieval architectures. The perfect juxtaposition of the projected image and the original building shape makes this illusion more realistic. The choice of color combination also creates an environment of the Middle Ages.<p>

	<p>In the darkness and with all these dreamy lights, people became more courageous and willing to expose themselves to the public.

	<a2>Ways Lights can be Manipulated:</a2>
	<p>Color<br>
		Intensity<br>
		Size<br>
		Shape<br>
		Composition<br>
		Frequency<br>


	<p>Light is a media that can be manipulated easier than many other art materials. It also does not require complicated artboards. By using lights and the darkness at night, the artists can usually create a complete new atmosphere at a common place where seems boring at daytime. Controlled by projectors and cameras, applying different color combinations, the lights transform the environment into Alice's wonderland. The audience can have a grand party, as well as discovering the unseen beauty of the city.<p>
