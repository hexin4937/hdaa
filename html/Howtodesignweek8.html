	<b><i>CONCEPT</i></b>
	<p><b>Modular light building blocks</b></p>
	
	<p>At beginning of this project, I got interested in interactive lighting. I have looked into many public light shows and home smart lighting systems.</p>

	<p>Therefore, I decided to create modular lights that can be portable when interconnected, but also has the potential to be anything when expanded.</p>

	<p>CHARACTERSTICS: Interactive, small, portable, easy connection.</p>

	<b><i>CONTEXT</i></b><br>

	<p><b>Playable Educational Lighting Blocks for Children</b></p>

	<p>It is small and versatile. With it, children can learn about lighting and circuit. They will be able to figure out how to wire a complete circuit through playing with the blocks, as well as DIY their own desk lamp.</p>

<div class="contentbox2">
	<b><i>PHYSICAL MODELS</i></b><br>

	<p><b>Shape = Cellular Packing</b></p>
	<p>In order to discover the best shape for portable and expandable, I have tested different nesting forms.</p>
	<img src="../pic/week6/8.jpg" width="250" height="250" border="3"/>
	<img src="../pic/week6/83.jpg" width="250" height="250" border="3"/>

	<p>Then I researched on cellular packing, and foudn out that most cellular packing uses triangles, cubes or hexagons as basic building blocks. Hexagon is also consisted of 6 equilateral triangles. Therefore, a nesting can be built energy efficiently from equilateral triangles.</p>

	<p><b>Electronics</b></p>
	<p><u>1. In Parallel</u></p><br>
	<img src="../pic/week8/parallelcircuit.jpg" width="250" height="250" border="3"/>
	<p>When the modules are in parallel, they light up one by one.</p>
	<video width="640" height="480" controls>
	<source src="../pic/week8/parallel.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>
</div>

<div class="contentbox2">
	<p>However, parallel modules have limitation in the freedom of connnection.</p>
	<img src="../pic/week8/parallelfreedom.jpg" width="250" height="250" border="3"/>
	<p>Also parallel modules will result in 2 different kinds of modules.</p>
	<img src="../pic/week8/parallelproblem.jpg" width="360" height="240" border="3"/>
 
</div>

<div class="contentbox2">
	<p><b>2. In Series</b></p><br>
	<img src="../pic/week8/seriescircuit.jpg" width="250" height="250" border="3"/>
	<p>When the modules are in series, they light up when the circuit is completed.</p>
	<video width="640" height="480" controls>
	<source src="../pic/week8/series.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

	<p>In this video, it shows that connecting in series currently have a problem of not enough voltage when divided between different LEDs.</p>

	<p>In series modules will have more degree of freedome. The module can rotate around the point of contact.</p>
	<img src="../pic/week8/seriesfreedom1.jpg" width="250" height="250" border="3"/>
	<img src="../pic/week8/seriesfreedom2.jpg" width="250" height="250" border="3"/><br>

	<p>Thus, I still want to dig deeper in figuring out how to light up modules in series.<br>Some solutions I have in mind right now are to use variable voltage source or variable resistor to create a constant current in the circuit. These solution can also teach children the relationship between voltage, current and resistance in circuit.</p>

<div class="contentbox2">
	<b><i>FUTURE PLAN</i></b>
	<p>1.Start testing a soft silicon material<br>2. Test out more about variable resistance and variable voltage .</p>
