	<p>Which light reminds you of home?<br>Which light reminds you of work?<br>Which light makes you happy?<br>Which light makes you sad?<br></p>

	<p>This is my room. It is a smalll cosy room with lots of stuffed animals. However, when it is shined with a cold blue light, it does not feel the same way again.<br><p>
</div>

<div class="contentbox2">
	<b>Light = Feeling</b>
	<p>A city view out of a regular living room window. What is your feeling towards these homes? How do you picture the families living in them?<p>

<div class="contentbox2">
	<b>Light = Expectation</b>
	<p>It is the same box, but people expect different gifts from them.<p>

<div class="contentbox2">
	<b>Light = Emotion</b>
	<p>My face. How do you think I feel?<p>

	<img src="../pic/week3/face1.jpg" width="300" height="240" border="0"/>
	<img src="../pic/week3/face2.jpg" width="300" height="240" border="0"/>

	<img src="../pic/week3/face4.jpg" width="300" height="240" border="0"/>

	<p>Most people say: the blue one feels sad, the red one is angry, in the orange one you are happy and in the green one you are desperate. However, it is the same face.

</div>


<div class="contentbox2">
	<b>Light = Metaphor</b>
	<p>Red light means warning.<br> Green light means safe.</br> How about these ones?<p>
 
	<img src="../pic/week3/heels2.jpg" width="320" height="240" border="0"/>
	<img src="../pic/week3/shoe.jpg" width="320" height="240" border="0"/>	

	<p>A pair of heels outside of a nightclub? An abandoned shoe?<br> They are just random things I found in my living room.<p>

</div>

<div class="contentbox2">
	<p>Light carries feeling, emotion and metaphor. The same object or face can appear different with different lights. Therefore, whether a person feels safe or unsafe in darkness may not depend on as simple as darkness, but more on what light is present in that darkness. Light is the creator in darkness. It creates emotions and endorses them to the people in the darkness.</p>
